# Overview

I like web development, and wanted to become more familiar with React. I also really enjoy D&D and would eventually like to make a full web app for my own personal use at the table, including a character sheet filler/tracker, a die roller, and maybe even initiative and combat notes. This is the first of many projects to fulfill that larger goal.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

# Web Pages

I only have one web page at the moment, but it dynamically creates a random number generator and rolls a random number based on the user's input. Eventually, this will be multiple random number generators of the appropriate parameters.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode.

I used Javascript, a bit of CSS for styling, and the REACT library.

# Future Work

- I'm going to fix the multiple-roll functionality, and I would like to make it possible to roll multiple dice of different types, such as 1 d8 and 2 d6.
- I want to add support for roll modifications, such as adding 3 to whatever is rolled.
- This is purely for aesthetics, but I would like to create an animation of a die rolling, even if it's still a flat, spinning image like the one in the header.
- I want to add an ability for the user to put in a number for the roll to beat, judge whether it beat the number, then tell the user both the roll and whether the roll beat the number given at once.
